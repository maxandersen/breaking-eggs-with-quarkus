That is a proper cake!

Excellent performance,
Ability to have super density
- all somethig that make your devops team
happy and especially the financial department
and even better yet - your users can wait less if done right!

And then the toppings are the awesome developer experience.

== Start Breaking Eggs

image::images/kid-breaking-egg.avif[background, size=cover]

== icon:egg[set=fas] Configuration can be changed at/after startup

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

=== Build and Runtime config

[%step]
* icon:heart[] Reduce classes needed to load
* Use Build time info to discard runtime need
* Example: Only load Hibernate Dialects as needed, Don't load configuration at runtime, ...

[%notitle,background-iframe="https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config"]
=== All Configuration

== icon:egg[set=fas] All Beans are available to lookup

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

== Removal of Unused Beans

* 1 bean = 3 generated classes
* Big app with some unused beans = waste of time and memory

https://quarkus.io/blog/unused-beans/

=== What are removed ?

Everything, except beans that...:

* ...are `@Named`

* ...have an observer method (`@Observes`)

* ...are annotated with `@Unremovable`

* ...are excluded via `quarkus.arc.unremovble-types` config 

* ...are identified by Quarkus Extensions

=== Bean removal

* icon:heart[] Less classes loaded, faster startup, less memory used
* Lookup using `CDI.current()` not detectable.
* Solution:
** Use `@Unremovable` or `unremovable-types` config 
** Turn removal off with: `quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans=false`

== icon:egg[set=fas] static blocks run at startup

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

== Static initi at build time

* icon:heart[set=fas] Quarkus initializes all classes at build time = faster startup
* You or some "bad" library might have static init

[source,java]
----
class MyClass {
    static Random random = new Random();
    ...
}
----

=== Static initialization solutions

[%step]
** Don't do static init!
*** `@Observes StartupEvent` and `@Startup` bean
*** Lazy initialization
** Write Quarkus Extension to handle it

== Why inflict "pain" on users?

[%notitle]
== Why:

[quote, Luis from Cap Gemini Spain]
We went from 50(!) seconds startup with our previous used framework. 
To just 2-3 seconds with Quarkus in JVM mode and 15ms in native mode with GraalVM.

=== Get Used to it

[%step]
* Today it is hard as libraries assume runtime init of all statics
* Quarkus give glimpse of future using GraalVM substitutions (raw speed!)
* Expect Project Leyden or similar to introduce true static init in Java

== Breaking Development Experience Eggs!


== icon:egg[set=fas] You have to restart your app to see changes

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

== `quarkus dev`

[%steps]
* A Special run mode 
* icon:heart[] Can use full power and memory as dev need
* Hot-reload on incoming requests
* icon:heart[] Change method, classes, packages, dependencies, ...
* icon:heart[] Restart in less time than you will notice

== icon:egg[set=fas] I have to setup my own testing infrastructure

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

== Quarkus Dev Services

[%step]
* With `quarkus dev` services based on your classpath/extension list
* But only IFF they are not configured
* Evergrowing list of supported services

[%notitle,background-iframe="https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services"]
=== Quarkus Dev Services2

== icon:egg[set=fas] I have to write tests first

[%step]
image::images/brokenegg.png[]

== Continous Testing

[%step]
* Press 'r' in `quarkus dev`
* or Run standalone
* Smart continuous test execution
* While you write code

== Why `quarkus dev` ?

[%step]
- Developers actually get to use it!

== Everybody gets Cake

== Cracked eggs

[%step]
- icon:egg[set=fas] Configuration can be changed at/after startup
- icon:egg[set=fas] All Beans are available to lookup
- icon:egg[set=fas] static blocks run at startup
- icon:egg[set=fas] I have to restart my app to see changes
- icon:egg[set=fas] I have to setup my own testing infrastructure
- icon:egg[set=fas] I have to write tests first

== Conclusion

[%step]
* Quarkus is supersonic and subatomic Java
** Developers get to have joy
** Operations gets resources
** Customers get what they need faster
* Because we broke some eggs!
